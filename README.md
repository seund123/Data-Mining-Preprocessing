# Exploring Data-Mining and Preprocessing
This project marks one of my first deep dives into data handling and cleaning using various data libraries. The goal was to explore essential preprocessing techniques to improve data quality and prepare it for analysis or modeling.

Key Preprocessing Techniques
1. Feature Scaling:
Applied normalization and standardization to numeric features for consistent scaling across the dataset.
2. Dimensionality Reduction:
Utilized feature selection to remove irrelevant or redundant variables.
Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract meaningful features while reducing dimensionality.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Next Steps
Experimenting with advanced feature engineering techniques.
Applying clustering and predictive modeling on preprocessed data.
