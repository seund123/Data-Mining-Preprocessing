# Data-Mining-Preprocessing
To enhance the quality and extract meaningful insights from noisy data, I employed a range of preprocessing techniques. First, data cleaning was pivotal; I identified and handled outliers and missing values. For numeric features, I performed normalization and standardization to ensure uniform scaling.Also including feature selection to reduce dimensionality and feature extraction via methods like PCA.
