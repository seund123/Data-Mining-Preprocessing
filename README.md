# Data-Mining and Preprocessing

To extract meaningful insights from noisy data, I implemented a comprehensive suite of preprocessing techniques:

Data Cleaning: Identified and handled outliers and missing values to ensure data integrity.
Feature Scaling: Applied normalization and standardization to numeric features for consistent scaling across the dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilized feature selection to eliminate irrelevant variables and employed techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction.
